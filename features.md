# CareerQuest Hub - Feature Outline

This document details the core features and integrations for the CareerQuest Hub platform, encompassing the WordPress website, the mobile game application (CareerQuest), and the messaging channel bots (Telegram/WhatsApp).

## WordPress Website Features

The WordPress site serves as the central repository and primary interface for CareerQuest Hub. It will host comprehensive **job and scholarship listings**, likely implemented using custom post types or specialized plugins to allow for detailed filtering, searching, and management. Each listing will contain relevant information such as description, requirements, location, deadlines, and application links. Alongside listings, the site will feature a rich library of **career guides and resources**, presented as standard WordPress posts or pages, covering topics relevant to recent graduates, such as resume writing, interview skills, and industry insights. Content will be SEO-optimized to attract organic traffic.

To enhance user value, the site will incorporate **interactive tools**. A **Resume Builder** will allow users to create and manage professional resumes using predefined templates and sections. A **Scholarship Matcher** tool will help users find relevant scholarships based on their profile information (e.g., field of study, academic achievements). These tools might be developed as custom plugins or integrated via third-party services.

A key component will be the **Community Forum** (potentially using bbPress or a similar plugin), providing a space for users to connect, ask questions, share experiences, and support each other in their career journeys. User profiles will be central, storing not only basic information but also tracking progress, saved listings, and importantly, **gamification status** received from the CareerQuest mobile app. This status, stored as user metadata, will include points, earned badges, and achievement levels.

Crucially, **game achievements will unlock specific features or content on the website**. For example, reaching a certain point threshold or earning a specific badge in the CareerQuest app could grant users **early access** to newly posted job listings, unlock premium career guides, provide enhanced profile visibility, or offer cosmetic upgrades within the community forum. The website backend will check the user's game-related metadata to dynamically grant these privileges, creating a tangible link between game engagement and platform benefits.

## Messaging Channel Features (Telegram/WhatsApp)

The Telegram and WhatsApp channels will function as real-time communication arms of the platform, pushing relevant information directly to users. Bots will manage these channels, providing **automated alerts** for new job and scholarship listings that match user-defined preferences (stored in their WordPress profile). Users will be able to configure alert frequency and criteria.

Beyond simple alerts, the bots will offer **personalized updates and engagement**. This could include daily or weekly digests of relevant opportunities, career tips sourced from the website's guides, and interactive elements like **polls** (e.g., 

What career field are you most interested in?) or **Q&A sessions** where users can submit questions to be answered by career advisors or the community. The bots will need to interact with the WordPress REST API to fetch user preferences, query for relevant content, and potentially update user profiles or trigger specific actions based on user interactions within the chat interface. User authentication or linking between the messaging platform account and the WordPress account will be necessary for personalization, possibly through a simple command that directs the user to log in on the website to authorize the bot.

## Mobile Game App Features (CareerQuest)

The CareerQuest mobile game app is designed to drive engagement and retention through gamification. It will be a career-themed application where users undertake tasks related to their job or scholarship search journey. Users will log in using their CareerQuest Hub (WordPress) credentials via the REST API, ensuring a unified user experience. The core gameplay loop will involve users completing **tasks** such as viewing a certain number of job listings (potentially deep-linked from the app to the website), completing short quizzes based on the career guides available on the site, updating their profile information, or even simulating parts of the application process.

Completing these tasks will earn users **points, badges, or other virtual rewards** within the app. The app will fetch the user's current game state (points, badges, achievements) from their WordPress user meta via the REST API and update it as tasks are completed. This gamified progress serves not only as a motivator within the app but also directly impacts their experience on the main website. As specified, achieving certain milestones or earning specific badges in CareerQuest will **unlock features on the WordPress site**, such as gaining early access to new listings or accessing exclusive content. The app will trigger these unlocks by updating the relevant user metadata fields through API calls.

The app will also serve as a **traffic driver** back to the WordPress site. Tasks will often require users to visit the website (e.g., "Read this career guide and answer a quiz," "View 5 new job postings in your field"), using deep links to direct users seamlessly to the relevant content or listings on the mobile-responsive WordPress site.

## Integration Points

The successful operation of CareerQuest Hub relies on seamless integration between its components, primarily facilitated by the WordPress REST API.

1.  **User Authentication:** WordPress serves as the central identity provider. The mobile app and messaging bots will authenticate users against WordPress credentials using OAuth 2.0 or Application Passwords via the REST API.
2.  **Profile Synchronization:** User profile information (preferences, saved items) will be managed in WordPress and accessed/updated by the app and bots via the API.
3.  **Gamification Data Flow:** The mobile app reads the user's game state (points, achievements) from WordPress user meta via the API. Upon task completion, the app writes updated game state back to WordPress via the API.
4.  **Feature Unlocking:** The WordPress site reads the user's game state from user meta to determine eligibility for unlocked features (e.g., early access). This check happens dynamically when the user accesses relevant site sections.
5.  **Content Delivery:** Bots and the mobile app fetch job/scholarship listings, career guides, and other relevant content from WordPress via the REST API.
6.  **Alerts & Notifications:** Bots query the WordPress API for new content matching user preferences to send alerts. The mobile app might also receive push notifications triggered by WordPress events (e.g., new relevant listing) via a separate notification service integrated with WordPress.
7.  **Traffic Referral:** The mobile app and messaging channels will use deep links or standard URLs to direct users to specific pages on the WordPress site.
