# CareerQuest Hub - System Architecture Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 23, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture for the CareerQuest Hub platform. CareerQuest Hub aims to be a unified ecosystem integrating job listings, scholarships, career resources, and gamified engagement targeting recent graduates. The platform comprises a WordPress website, Telegram/WhatsApp messaging channels, and a mobile game application (CareerQuest). This architecture is designed to support seamless integration, scalability, and the core value proposition of providing a fun, accessible, and community-driven experience for career and education opportunities.

## 2. Architectural Goals

*   **Unified User Experience:** Provide a consistent experience across the website, mobile app, and messaging channels.
*   **Integration:** Ensure seamless data flow and interaction between all platform components.
*   **Scalability:** Design the architecture to handle growing user numbers, content volume, and feature complexity.
*   **Maintainability:** Utilize standard technologies and practices to facilitate ongoing development and maintenance.
*   **Security:** Implement appropriate measures to protect user data and system integrity.
*   **Gamification Support:** Natively support the tracking and utilization of game mechanics (points, badges, achievements) across the platform.

## 3. System Components

The platform consists of the following primary components:

### 3.1. WordPress Website

*   **Description:** The central hub built on WordPress, acting as the primary user interface, content management system (CMS), and data repository.
*   **Core Functionalities:** User management (registration, login, profiles), job/scholarship listing management, career guide publication, interactive tools (Resume Builder, Scholarship Matcher), community forum, gamification state display, and feature unlocking based on game achievements.
*   **Technology:** WordPress (latest stable version), PHP, MySQL/MariaDB. Likely utilizes custom post types, custom fields (e.g., Advanced Custom Fields or native meta), and potentially plugins like bbPress for forums.

### 3.2. WordPress REST API

*   **Description:** The Application Programming Interface layer built into WordPress, extended as necessary with custom endpoints. It serves as the communication bridge between the WordPress backend and external applications.
*   **Core Functionalities:** Exposes endpoints for user authentication, CRUD operations on users, listings, game state (user meta), content retrieval, and potentially specific actions related to interactive tools or community features.
*   **Technology:** WordPress REST API (JSON format). Custom endpoints will be developed as needed within a custom plugin or theme.

### 3.3. Mobile Game App (CareerQuest)

*   **Description:** A mobile application designed for gamified engagement, encouraging users to interact with career-related tasks.
*   **Core Functionalities:** User login (via WordPress API), task presentation (viewing listings, quizzes, profile updates), point/badge awarding, fetching/updating game state from WordPress, deep-linking to the WordPress site.
*   **Technology:** Cross-platform framework recommended (React Native or Flutter) for broader reach. Communication with the backend exclusively via the WordPress REST API.

### 3.4. Messaging Bots (Telegram/WhatsApp)

*   **Description:** Automated bots operating on Telegram and WhatsApp platforms to deliver real-time updates and facilitate basic interactions.
*   **Core Functionalities:** User linking/authentication, fetching user preferences, querying WordPress API for new content, sending personalized alerts/digests, handling simple interactions (polls, Q&A).
*   **Technology:** Python is a suitable choice, utilizing libraries like `python-telegram-bot` for Telegram and the Twilio API (or similar) for WhatsApp. Bots will run on separate hosting infrastructure (e.g., VPS, serverless platform) and communicate with the WordPress REST API.

## 4. Integration Strategy

An API-centric approach is adopted, with the WordPress REST API serving as the central integration point.

*   **Authentication:** WordPress is the single source of truth for user identity. OAuth 2.0 (using a reliable WordPress plugin like WP OAuth Server) or WordPress Application Passwords will be implemented to provide secure, token-based authentication for the mobile app and messaging bots accessing the REST API.
*   **Data Flow:** WordPress remains the primary data store. The mobile app and bots interact with WordPress data exclusively through the REST API. The website interacts directly with the WordPress database and utilizes the API for dynamic features where appropriate.
*   **Gamification Synchronization:** User game state (points, badges, achievements, unlocked feature flags) will be stored as WordPress user metadata. The mobile app reads this data via GET requests and updates it via POST/PUT requests to the relevant user meta endpoints on the REST API. The website reads this metadata directly to control access to features.

## 5. Data Model (Conceptual)

*   **Users:** Standard WordPress users table, extended with custom metadata fields for profile information (e.g., field of study, preferences) and gamification state (e.g., `careerquest_points`, `careerquest_badges`, `careerquest_unlocked_features`).
*   **Listings (Jobs/Scholarships):** Custom Post Types (e.g., `job_listing`, `scholarship_listing`) with relevant custom fields (location, deadline, requirements, company, etc.).
*   **Content:** Standard WordPress posts/pages for guides and resources.
*   **Forum:** Handled by forum plugin data structures (e.g., bbPress tables).

## 6. Technology Stack Summary

*   **Backend/CMS:** WordPress, PHP, MySQL/MariaDB
*   **Web Frontend:** WordPress Theme (Custom/Customized)
*   **API:** WordPress REST API (JSON)
*   **Mobile App:** React Native / Flutter
*   **Bots:** Python (with relevant SDKs/APIs)
*   **Hosting:** Managed WordPress Hosting (for website), VPS or Serverless Platform (for bots).

## 7. Security Considerations

*   **API Security:** Use HTTPS for all API communication. Implement robust authentication (OAuth 2.0/Application Passwords). Validate and sanitize all API inputs. Implement rate limiting.
*   **WordPress Security:** Follow standard WordPress security best practices (strong passwords, regular updates, security plugins, file permissions).
*   **Data Privacy:** Comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). Ensure user consent for data collection and processing.
*   **Bot Security:** Secure bot tokens and API keys. Validate webhook requests (if used).

## 8. Deployment Strategy (Preliminary)

*   **WordPress Site:** Standard deployment process to a suitable hosting environment.
*   **Bots:** Deploy bot scripts to a VPS or serverless environment (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) for continuous operation.
*   **Mobile App:** Build and deploy through standard app store channels (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).
*   **CI/CD:** Consider implementing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
